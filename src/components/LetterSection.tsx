I wanted to take a moment on your special day to tell you how much you mean to me. Your friendship has been one of the greatest gifts in my life.

Through all the ups and downs, you've been there with your infectious laugh, your shoulder to lean on, and your incredible way of making even the most ordinary days feel special.

You have this amazing ability to light up any room you walk into, and your kindness touches everyone around you.

As you celebrate another trip around the sun, I hope you feel the love that surrounds you â€“ not just today, but every day. You deserve all the happiness in the world.

Thank you for being you. Thank you for being my friend. Here's to many more birthdays together!`;
